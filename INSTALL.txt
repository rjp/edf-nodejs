FAQ
---

Q: How do I build qUAck?
A: Type "./configure.sh" then "make" from the command line

Q: Will it work on <x>?
A: qUAck will compile and has been tested under

   - Linux (should work as is)
   - FreeBSD (ditto)
   - Windows (project files for your favourite IDE not supplied)
	
   Other systems cannot be guaranteed, but don't let that stop you.
	
Q: Make stops without compiling anything
A: It has problems with DOS style carriage return / line feeds. Run Makefile*
   qUAck/Makefile through dos2unix / duconv or load them into vi and do

   1,$s/<Ctrl>V<Ctrl>M//g

Q: "Cannot find openssl/openssl.h"
A: You don't not have SSL installed on your machine, or it is in a different
   place. Makefile.inc has SSL related stuff in it. Comment out the CCSECURE
   and LDSECURE lines

Q: "Stray '\' on line..."
A: See 'Make stops' above

qUAck looks the way it does as a result of 10 years UI "refinement" beginning
with old UNaXcess (circa 1984) and continuing until 1999 when we [the Manc CS
UA bods] were dragged kicking and screaming onto UNaXcess II

Old UA guilty parties: Brandon S Allbery, Andrew G Minter, Rob Partington,
Gryn Davies, Michael Wood, Andrew Armitage, Francis Cook, Brian Widdas

Special mention to Jason Williams (Khendon) and Tim Bannister (isoma) - my
favourite beta testers ever - who put up with bugs, compilation problems and
a host of other obstacles to help me fix things before public release,
Rob Partington (Phaedrus) for providing patches and using the exact opposite
of all my settings and forcing me to fix all the code I never see or use,
David Walters for his first time user suggestions.

Enjoy!

        Mike
